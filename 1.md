# 🚀 Flask CI/CD with Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Prometheus & Grafana

This project is a fully automated infrastructure and deployment pipeline for a **Flask-based web application** hosted on AWS. It uses **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning, **Ansible** for configuration and deployment, and **Docker** for containerizing the application and monitoring tools like **Prometheus**, **Node Exporter**, and **Grafana**.

The goal is to showcase a complete DevOps workflow using open-source tools, with modular code and infrastructure-as-code best practices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Flask** – Lightweight Python web framework for building the application.
- **Docker** – Containerizes the application and monitoring tools.
- **Docker Compose** – Manages multi-container setup (Flask, Prometheus, Grafana, Node Exporter).
- **Terraform** – Provisions AWS infrastructure as code (EC2, VPC, Subnets, ALB, Security Groups, etc.).
- **Ansible** – Handles server provisioning, app deployment, and monitoring stack automation.
- **Prometheus** – Time-series database and monitoring system.
- **Node Exporter** – Collects host-level system metrics.
- **Grafana** – Visualizes metrics and builds monitoring dashboards.
- **AWS** – Cloud provider hosting the entire infrastructure.
- **GitHub** – Source code repository and version control.

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed and configured on your local machine:

### 🔧 Tools Required

- **Terraform** (v1.0+ recommended)  
  Infrastructure provisioning

- **Ansible** (v2.9+ recommended)  
  Configuration management & automation

- **AWS CLI** (configured with credentials)  
  For Terraform & Ansible to interact with AWS

- **SSH Key Pair**  
  Required to access EC2 instance  
  ⚠️ **Do not upload your `.pem` key to any public repository**

- **Docker** & **Docker Compose**  
  For local testing and service orchestration (optional)

### 🔐 AWS Resources Required

- An AWS account with:
  - EC2, VPC, IAM, and ALB access
  - A valid key pair created in the EC2 section

### 📦 Python Packages (if running Ansible from virtualenv)

```bash
pip install boto boto3

Ensure your SSH key (.pem file) path and other variables are correctly configured inside the inventory.ini and ansible.cfg files.

## 🚀 How to Use

Follow these steps to provision infrastructure, deploy the app, and enable monitoring:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OmkarSG07/Flask-CI-CD.git
cd Flask-CI-CD

cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```
✅ This will set up the entire AWS infrastructure: VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateway, EC2 instance, and ALB.

After Terraform finishes, get the public IP of the EC2 instance from the output and update the inventory file:
# ansible/inventory.ini
[flask_server]
your-ec2-public-ip ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/path/to/your/key.pem

cd ../ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
✅ This installs Docker, runs the Flask app, and sets up Prometheus + Grafana on the EC2 instance.

5️⃣ Access the Services

    Flask App: http://<EC2-Public-IP>:5000

    Grafana Dashboard: http://<EC2-Public-IP>:3000

        Default Login: admin / admin

    Prometheus: http://<EC2-Public-IP>:9090

    Node Exporter Metrics: http://<EC2-Public-IP>:9100/metrics

    ## 📊 Monitoring Overview

This project integrates Prometheus and Grafana to monitor your Flask application running in Docker. Here's how the monitoring system is set up and how you can use it:

### 1️⃣ Prometheus Configuration

Prometheus is configured to scrape metrics from:

- **Node Exporter**: Provides hardware and OS metrics from the EC2 instance.
- **Flask App**: You can extend Prometheus to scrape Flask app-specific metrics by exposing an endpoint in your Flask application.

Prometheus config (`prometheus.yml`) is located in the `ansible/monitoring` directory and is set up to scrape both `Node Exporter` and `Flask App`.

---

### 2️⃣ Grafana Dashboard

Once the infrastructure is set up and the containers are running, you can access the Grafana dashboard at:

- **Grafana URL**: `http://<EC2-Public-IP>:3000`

#### Default Login:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin`

Upon logging in, you can import and view pre-configured dashboards to monitor:

- EC2 metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage, etc.)
- Flask application performance (e.g., request rate, response time)

> 🔧 You can also create custom dashboards and panels as per your monitoring needs.

---

### 3️⃣ Node Exporter

Node Exporter runs on the EC2 instance and exposes various system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network usage). It is available on port `9100`:

- **Node Exporter URL**: `http://<EC2-Public-IP>:9100/metrics`

---

### 4️⃣ Alerts (Optional)

You can configure alerting in Prometheus or Grafana to notify you on various conditions like:

- High CPU usage
- Flask app down
- Low disk space

This requires setting up notification channels like email, Slack, or others, depending on your preference.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

While working with Flask, Docker, Ansible, and Terraform, issues might arise. Here are some common problems and their solutions:

### 1️⃣ **EC2 Instance Not Starting**

- **Cause**: The EC2 instance might not have started successfully.
- **Solution**: 
  - Check EC2 instance status in the AWS console.
  - Ensure that the `ami_id` in your Terraform configuration is correct.
  - Review the instance's **System Logs** in the AWS console for error messages.

### 2️⃣ **Docker Containers Not Running**

- **Cause**: Docker containers might not be starting as expected.
- **Solution**: 
  - Check the container logs:
    ```bash
    docker logs <container-name>
    ```
  - Ensure Docker service is running:
    ```bash
    systemctl status docker
    ```
  - Inspect the running containers:
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
  
### 3️⃣ **Flask App Not Accessible**

- **Cause**: Flask app may not be accessible from the browser.
- **Solution**:
  - Verify if the Flask app container is running and the port is exposed properly (`5000:5000`).
  - Ensure the **Security Group** rules for the EC2 instance are configured correctly to allow access to port `5000`.
  - Check the **Docker logs** for the Flask app container:
    ```bash
    docker logs flask-app-container
    ```

### 4️⃣ **Prometheus/Grafana Not Displaying Data**

- **Cause**: Prometheus and Grafana may not be receiving data.
- **Solution**:
  - Ensure Prometheus is scraping both **Node Exporter** and the **Flask App**.
  - Check the Prometheus logs for any scraping errors.
  - Ensure the correct targets are listed in Prometheus' **`prometheus.yml`** file.
  - In Grafana, ensure the data source is correctly configured to point to the Prometheus instance.

### 5️⃣ **Terraform Apply Fails**

- **Cause**: Terraform might fail to apply changes due to misconfigurations.
- **Solution**:
  - Check the error messages printed by Terraform.
  - Ensure that AWS credentials are correctly configured for Terraform.
  - Run `terraform plan` to inspect the planned changes and validate before applying.
  - For any IAM-related issues, ensure the IAM user has the correct permissions for creating resources.

### 6️⃣ **Ansible Playbook Fails**

- **Cause**: The Ansible playbook might fail due to incorrect configurations or missing dependencies.
- **Solution**:
  - Check the output logs for the error messages.
  - Ensure the EC2 instance is reachable and that SSH keys are correctly configured.
  - Verify that the necessary roles and variables are defined in the `ansible/` directory.
  - Run the playbook with increased verbosity for more detailed logs:
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -v playbook.yml
    ```
  
### 7️⃣ **Security Group Issues**

- **Cause**: EC2 instances or services might not be accessible due to misconfigured security groups.
- **Solution**:
  - Verify the security group rules in the AWS Console.
  - Ensure that ports like `5000` (Flask app) and `3000` (Grafana) are open to the right CIDR blocks.
  - Check for overlapping security group configurations that may cause conflicts.
